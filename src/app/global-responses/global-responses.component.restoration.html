    <p class="mb-5">
        The process of assisting the recovery of ecosystems that have been degraded, damaged, or destroyed. It involves restoring the structure, function, and biodiversity of ecosystems to a natural or semi-natural state. Habitat restoration is key to this process and can be achieved through plantings of natural vegetation, allowing ecological successional processes to take place, reintroducing species and returning geomorphology to more natural configurations. By definition the time required to restore an ecosystem element varies (e.g., annual vs perennial vegetation). The result of the restoration effort is often variable over space and time. The result tends to mimic and not necessarily equate to the exact natural habitat and community that was the product of evolutionary and ecological timescales. It can relate to restoration of specific elements as part of Natura 2000 site management guidance, or for a specific biodiversity conservation goal (e.g. rare species protection or re-introduction under Habitats Directive), improvement in a particular ecosystem service (e.g. urban water or carbon management or as part of agroecological farming practices) or a initiative to rewild an area to restore a biodiverse and resilient ecosystem. There are therefore various possible connections to policies and initiatives applicable to different environments, such as Nature Protection Regulations, and Urban greening plans.
