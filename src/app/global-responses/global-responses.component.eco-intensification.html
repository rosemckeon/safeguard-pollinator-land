    <p class="mb-5">
        A nature-based approach to agriculture requiring a redesign of the farming system. Ecological intensification aims to maintain or increase long-term agricultural productivity, while reducing reliance on synthetic inputs and the need for agricultural land expansion. This requires actively managing the cultivated and non-cultivated biodiversity in the farm system to enhance ecological processes and services that support agricultural crop performance (yield amount or stability). This management can include diversified crop planting (see Diversified farming systems below), restorative management of soil health, semi-natural habitat conservation, and creation of ecological infrastructures (e.g., perennial woody habitat, flower rich areas). This management aims to promote (functional) biodiversity, ecosystem functions and delivery of crop pollination and natural biocontrol services against crop pests, weeds and diseases. Ecological intensification can also provide wider benefits (e.g., system resilience to environmental stressors, promote soil carbon stocks, reduced pollution from agrochemical run-off) thereby reducing and responding to wider environmental impacts. Ecological intensification takes a more transformative approach to agriculture, which targets a REDESIGN of the farming system and a holistic approach to management of cultivated and semi-natural elements.
