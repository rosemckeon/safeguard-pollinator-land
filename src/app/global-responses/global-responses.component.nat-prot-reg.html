<h2 mat-dialog-title><strong>Nature Protection Regulations</strong></h2>
<mat-dialog-content>
    <p class="mb-5">
        Legal frameworks or directives enacted by governments to regulate and safeguard natural environments, ecosystems, and biodiversity. They typically encompass a range of provisions aimed at conserving and managing natural resources, protecting wildlife and their habitats, and promoting sustainable land use practices. The European Commission’s Birds and Habitats Directives and Natura 2000 network are existing (interrelated) examples of these types of regulations in the EU. There is also the 2022-2024 proposal for a Nature Restoration Law (NRL), which is a key element of the EU Biodiversity Strategy. The NRL calls for binding targets to restore degraded ecosystems. The proposal aims to restore ecosystems, habitats and species across the EU’s land and sea in order to enable the long-term and sustained recovery of biodiverse and resilient nature, contribute to achieving the EU’s climate mitigation and climate adaptation objectives and to meet international commitments. Unlike the earlier Directives/Natura 2000, the NRL has a specific target of reversing pollinator decline by 2030 together with targets for improving habitat and biodiversity in urban, forest and agricultural zones. As of 03/2024, there remains considerable political resistance to the NRL and thus uncertainty about whether the NRL will be adopted by EU member states.
