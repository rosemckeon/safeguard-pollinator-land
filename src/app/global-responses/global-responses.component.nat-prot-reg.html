  <p class="mb-5">Legal frameworks or directives enacted by governments to regulate and safeguard natural environments, ecosystems, and biodiversity. They typically encompass a range of provisions aimed at conserving and managing natural resources, protecting wildlife and their habitats, and promoting sustainable land use practices.</p>
  <p class="mb-5">The European Commission's Birds and Habitats Directives and Natura 2000 network are existing (interrelated) examples of these types of regulations in the EU. There is also the 2022-2024 proposal for a Nature Restoration Law (NRL), which is a key element of the EU Biodiversity Strategy.</p>
  <p class="mb-5">The NRL calls for binding targets to restore degraded ecosystems. The proposal aims to restore ecosystems, habitats and species across the EUâ€™s land and sea in order to enable the long-term and sustained recovery of biodiverse and resilient nature, contribute to achieving the EU's climate mitigation and climate adaptation objectives and to meet international commitments.</p>
  <p class="mb-5">Unlike the earlier Directives/Natura 2000, the NRL has a specific target of reversing pollinator decline by 2030 together with targets for improving habitat and biodiversity in urban, forest and agricultural zones. As of 03/2024, there remains considerable political resistance to the NRL and thus uncertainty about whether the NRL will be adopted by EU member states.</p>
