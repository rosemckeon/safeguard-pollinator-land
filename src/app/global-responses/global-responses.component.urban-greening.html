        The EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030 calls upon cities with over 20.000 inhabitants to create Urban Greening Plans by the end of 2021. These plans aim to bring nature back into cities to support biodiversity and mitigate climate change. To help cities achieve this ambitious goal, the European Commission will create an EU Urban Greening Platform, under a new ‘Green City Accord’ with cities and mayors. Signatory cities are engaged in making considerable progress in conserving and enhancing urban biodiversity, including increasing the extent and quality of green areas in cities and halting the loss of and restoring urban ecosystems. There are organisations of cities and local government, e.g. EUROCITIES and ICLEI, working with communities and business, that are addressing issues around urban greening for multiple sustainability goals, including biodiversity.
