    <p class="mb-5">Pollination is the process by which pollen is transferred from the male reproductive organs (anthers) to the female reproductive organs (stigma) of flowers, leading to fertilisation and the production of seeds and fruits. Many flowering crops depend on insects for the transport of pollen.</p>
    <p class="mb-5">This process within or between individual crop plants of the same species (autogamy/geitonogamy/xenogamy) can help to promote the amount, quality or stability over time of the crop yield produced. Pollination, in this respect of food production, provides a regulating ecosystem service to humankind.</p>
