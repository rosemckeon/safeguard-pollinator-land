<h2 mat-dialog-title><strong>Aesthetic Values</strong></h2>
<mat-dialog-content>
    <p class="mb-5">The perceived benefits and enjoyment that people (individually or collectively) derive from the sensory and recreational qualities of (semi)natural landscapes, as well as specific habitats or other elements within those landscapes. Pollinators and pollination can play a direct contributory role in the creation of certain plant communities, habitats or landscapes that provide such aesthetic value. Pollinators themselves through their presence and visible or auditory behaviour may contribute to this sensory quality and the aesthetic value.</p>
