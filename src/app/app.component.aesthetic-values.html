    <p class="mb-5">Pollinators and pollination can play a direct contributory role in the creation of certain plant communities, habitats or landscapes that provide such aesthetic value. Pollinators themselves through their presence and visible or auditory behaviour may contribute to this sensory quality and the aesthetic value.</p>
