<mat-dialog-content>
    <p class="mb-5">Linked to and downstream of the regulating ecosystem service of crop pollination underpinning crop yields, this encompasses a series of interconnected human activities starting with the crop cultivation and yield and leading to subsequent food processing, distribution, marketing and sales. This chain of events involves multiple economic values derived at each step by different actors ranging from agricultural industries (farmers and associated agribusiness) to food producers and retailers and ultimately consumers.</p>
