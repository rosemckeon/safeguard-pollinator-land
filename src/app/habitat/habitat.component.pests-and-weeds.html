        Pests are organisms that cause harm or damage to crops, livestock, forests, structures, human health, or other desirable components of ecosystems or human environments. Weeds are plants that grow in locations where they are not wanted or are considered undesirable by humans due to their competitive ability, invasiveness, and negative impacts on agricultural or natural ecosystems. However, many flowering weed species provide floral resources to pollinators.
