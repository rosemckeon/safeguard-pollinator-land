<h2 mat-dialog-title><strong>Wild pollinator abundance and diversity</strong></h2>
<mat-dialog-content class="habitat">
    <p class="mb-5">
      The number of individuals (or biomass) and taxonomic (or functional) diversity of wild pollinators, including bees, flies, butterflies/moths, beetles and other insects in a specific time or place.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-5">
      Wild pollinator abundance and diversity is tightly corrrelated with measures of floral resources - the variety and amount of flowering plant species available in a habitat or landscape over time, which provide to pollinators (and other insects) different sources of calories and macro- and micro-nutrients (e.g. lipids, amino acids) contained in pollen and nectar.
