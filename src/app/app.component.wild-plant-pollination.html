    <p class="mb-5">Pollination is the process by which pollen is transferred from the male reproductive organs (anthers) to the female reproductive organs (stigma) of flowers, leading to fertilisation and the production of seeds and fruits.</p>
    <p class="mb-5">The majority of flowering plant species depend obligately or facultatively on insects for the transport of pollen in ways that support this sexual reproduction and production of seeds/fruits. In obligately or facultatively outcrossing flowering plant species, insect-mediated pollination is important in maintaining the long-term genetic fitness and health of their populations (e.g., avoidance of inbreeding and accumulation of deleterious alleles).</p>
